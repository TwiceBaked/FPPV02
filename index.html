            I am planning on working on this project myself and will have no teammates.
            End users will be able to download and install is product and run it on their local device. This product will give them the ability to record which keys they press the most.
            This product will be deployed using Docker and Go. The program itself will be written in Go while the deployment of the product will be handled by Docker.
            The features will include storing how many time each key was clicked. The ability to start and stop the recording.
            This will run through the command line and should be very lightweight so that it is unnoticeable when its running.
