            Project Name: kamelKase
        </h1>
        <h2>
            I am planning on working on this project myself and will have no teammates.
            End users will be able to download and install this product and run it on their local device. This product will be some sort of command line application.
            This product will be deployed using Docker, Chololatey, and Go. The program itself will be written in Go while the deployment of the product will be handled by Docker and Chololatey.
            I plan to make a command line game. It will be some sort of infinite running game. One where high scores can be recorded.
            One feature I would like to implement is the ablility to have player accounts in order to see who has the highest score. 
            The game should also run on both macOS and Windows command lines.
